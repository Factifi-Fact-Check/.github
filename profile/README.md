# Factifi üöÄ

**Fact Checking the Internet. Empowering data-driven trust online, one claim at a time.**

## The Problem ‚ùì

In today's digital age, it's increasingly difficult to discern truth from misinformation. The sheer volume of online content, coupled with the rise of sophisticated AI-generated text and "hallucinations," erodes trust and makes it challenging for individuals to rely on the information they consume.

From viral podcasts and influential blogs to everyday social media, misleading or entirely false claims can spread rapidly, influencing opinions, decisions, and public discourse. There's an urgent need for tools that help users critically evaluate content in real-time.

## Our Solution ‚ú®

**Factifi** is an AI-powered Chrome Extension and platform designed to tackle this challenge head-on. We are building a tool that allows users to:

1.  **Extract** key claims from digital content (initially focusing on YouTube videos, long-form podcasts, and blogs).
2.  **Verify** these claims by leveraging:
    *   Advanced **Large Language Models (LLMs)** like GPT and Gemini.
    *   Real-time **Web Search** (via SERP API).
    *   Extensive **Research Databases** (including 200M+ papers from sources like Semantic Scholar).
3.  **Evaluate** the credibility of these claims, presenting users with clear, actionable insights, confidence scores, and supporting citations directly within their browsing experience.

Our mission is to empower individuals and organizations to make data-driven decisions by ensuring the credibility of information in an increasingly complex world.

*   **Content Focus:** Initially targeting YouTube videos (especially long podcasts) and blogs.
*   **Clear Confidence Scores:** Quickly understand the likely veracity of a claim.
*   **Sourced Citations:** See the evidence and sources behind each verification.

## Technology Stack üõ†Ô∏è

*   **AI/NLP:** Python, GPT API, Gemini API, Custom NLP Pipelines
*   **Backend:** Python, Flask
*   **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## Current Status & Roadmap üó∫Ô∏è

Factifi is currently in the **prototype/MVP (Minimum Viable Product) development stage**.
*   We have a functional prototype that integrates our core technologies (Python, LLM APIs, SERP, Semantic Scholar).
*   We are actively working on refining the user experience (HTML, CSS, JS, Flask for the extension interface) and the claim extraction/verification algorithms.
*   Our immediate goal is to launch a **Beta version** of the Chrome Extension for wider user testing and feedback.
*   Long-term vision includes expanding to other content types (e.g., livestreams), exploring political use cases, and developing an API for enterprise solutions.
